# Classification with Nearest Neighbors algorithm

This project is a Python implementation of classification with the Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It receives three CSV files (train, validation, and test sets) containing labeled data and predicts the labels of the test set based on the Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can install them using pip:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn scipy
```

## Usage

To use the Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification, you need to have three CSV files containing the labeled data(the data should be numeric). The first file should be the training set, the second should be the validation set, and the third should be the test set.
